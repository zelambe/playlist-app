Problems with my app

Whenever you search for something, the keyboard pushes up the list fragments
that I have, so the search box gets covered (but it works!)

Also, whenever you add as song to the playlist, the app will crash if you try
to go back to the main activity. This is caused by an indexing error in my
oberver for my playlist that I dont know how to fix

Creative Portion:

Songs in the playist have the picture of the album art on the side
